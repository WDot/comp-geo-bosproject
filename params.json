These problems benefit\r\nfrom a structure where each data point in a sample is geometrically aligned in an ùëõ-dimensional array.\r\nRecently, there have been efforts made at adopting these techniques for use in graph data.\r\nGraphs are more flexible than arrays in that they are simply vertices connected by edges with no\r\ninherent geometric interpretation. Dr. Ptucha‚Äôs Machine Intelligence Lab is building upon these works\r\nwith their own (unpublished) graph deep learning architecture, called Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. The author is interested in applying this\r\narchitecture to classification with 3D models. 3D models can be formulated as graphs as they are also\r\nessentially vertices connected by edges. The Bosphorous 3D dataset will be taken as input into a\r\n‚ÄúGraph-CNN‚Äù neural network and the network‚Äôs ability to discern facial expressions and genders will be\r\nstudied. Initially only convolutional layers will be used, but if time allows pooling layers will be explored.\r\nIn addition, if time allows, 3d polygonal neuron visualizations will be generated.\r\nAll the work for this project will be done by Miguel Dominguez, though the architecture has come from Dr. Raymond Ptucha's Machine Intelligence Lab.\r\n\r\n#Status\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMiguel Dominguez @WDot mad6384@rit.edu",
