<p>Deep Learning has been successfully applied to signal and image problems. These problems benefit
from a structure where each data point in a sample is geometrically aligned in an 𝑛-dimensional array.
Recently, there have been efforts made at adopting these techniques for use in graph data.
Graphs are more flexible than arrays in that they are simply vertices connected by edges with no
inherent geometric interpretation. Dr. Ptucha’s Machine Intelligence Lab is building upon these works
with their own (unpublished) graph deep learning architecture, called Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. The author is interested in applying this
architecture to classification with 3D models. 3D models can be formulated as graphs as they are also
essentially vertices connected by edges. The Bosphorous 3D dataset will be taken as input into a
“Graph-CNN” neural network and the network’s ability to discern facial expressions and genders will be
studied. Initially only convolutional layers will be used, but if time allows pooling layers will be explored.
In addition, if time allows, 3d polygonal neuron visualizations will be generated.
All the work for this project will be done by Miguel Dominguez, though the architecture has come from Dr. Raymond Ptucha's Machine Intelligence Lab.</p>
